# MachineLearning
This is the course project of machine learning on coursera.

### Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression
In this exercise, I will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.

### Programming Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
In this exercise, I will implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets. 

### Programming Exercise 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
In this exercise, I will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

### Programming Exercise 4: Neural Networks Learning
In this exercise, I will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. 

### Programming Exercise 5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
In this exercise, I will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties. 

### Programming Exercise 6: Support Vector Machines
In this exercise, I will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

### Programming Exercise 7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
In this exercise, I will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. In the second part, I will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

### Programming Exercise 8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
In this exercise, I will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, I will use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
